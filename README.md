# Emost-Bot
Emost-Bot is a music bot for discord using only voice commands. It will listen to only one person who types the !connect command in a text channel. 

# Text Commands(prefix: !)
* connect
* disconnect

# Voice Commands (hotword: bumblebee)
* play {song name}
* skip
* pause
* resume

# Known Issues
* None as far as I'm aware when only connecting to one server, may have issues with multiple connections

# Planned Updates
* Add a signal to indicate the hotword has been recognized (e.g. ping noise when hotword is heard).
* Allow the ability to listen to multiple users as opposed to one.
* More commands
* etc

# What will not be implemented
* Text Commands associated audio interaction

# Hosting your own voice recognition bot
The voice recognition bot requires google speech to text API key to function the speech to text and discord token for the bot.
